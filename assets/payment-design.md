- [Stripe payments](https://stripe.com/en-de/payments)
  - tested and functioning with the Sustainable Science Symposium tickets
- Ping SQL database for sign of life prior to payment process
- Registry
  - Send simple payment request (1EUR p/module) to Stripe
  - Webhook passes Dat key(s) to SQL database
  - Registry containers listen for new entries to SQL db, replicate and seed versioned Dat archives
- Computations
  - Need a model to determine price for the computation
    - Factors: nodes, edges, analysis, machine specs
    - Model estimates the seconds needed to run analysis
      - Need to track how much time we spend to test this (but have $3000 of credits at AWS so we can test a bit)
  - Urgent computations require extra $$ --> maybe upgrade what machine we run it on?
  - Send complex payment request to Stripe (based on predicted duration and machine price p/second)
  - Upon payment
    - initiate machine or send to queue of compute cluster
      - Compute cluster based on [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) makes sense if there are many jobs, at start we'll just initiate machines on demand
    - way we run the computations depends on the graph data structure and compute type, which we'll add later.
