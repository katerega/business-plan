# Hypergraph registry design

- Main SQL database with API endpoint
  - GET always allowed
  - POST only allowed with a specific token/private key that weâ€™ll feed in to Stripe and use webhooks to add Dat keys
- Maybe we reverse proxy this so we can scale the SQL database with Kubernetes?
- Docker image that automatically reseeds from the main SQL database
- Kubernetes to scale
- Need to test the AWS/GCP pipeline for this.
