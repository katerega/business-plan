# Liberate Science manifesto

Scientific practice as we know it is going to change. 

Science doesn’t happen in isolation.
The need to be more open, share knowledge, and make participation more inclusive is essential for making science more effective at solving real-world problems. 

Look at how right now preprints and datasets are shared to find a vaccine for Corona. We are convinced that this is how science should be, not only for pandemics like Corona but for all research, from clean water technology to behavioural patterns of ants.

In order to do so, we step in at the root. 

We’ve made it our mission to create a framework following the principles of distributed ownership. We set a standard for building usable tools for cooperation and peer review, while securing provenance and authorship and removing friction from your life as a researcher. We want you to decide what is important for your work.

And even though we don’t know what the eventual outcome will be, we do firmly believe that taking science out of the hands of the few is the way forward.
